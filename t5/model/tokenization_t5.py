class T5Tokenizer(PreTrainedTokenizer):
    """
    Construct a T5 tokenizer. Based on [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) file (generally has a *.spm* extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        extra_ids (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 100):
           Add a number of extra ids added to the vocabulary for use as sentinels. These tokens are
            accessible as "<extra_id_{%d}>" where "{%d}" is a number between 0 and extra_ids-1. These tokens can be
            retrieved by calling get_sentinel_tokens method and token ids can be by calling get_sentinel_token_ids
            method
         additional_special_tokens (`List[str]`, *optional*):
            Additional special tokens used by the tokenizer.
        sp_model_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
            Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for
            SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things,
            to set:

            - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
            - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
              - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.
        legacy (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not the `legacy` behaviour of the tokenizer should be used. Legacy is before the merge of #24622
            and #25224 which includes fixes to properly handle tokens that appear after special tokens. A simple
            example:

            - `legacy=True`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer

            >>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google-t5/t5-base", legacy=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <extra_id_0>.")
            [8774, 32099, 3, 5, 1]
            ```
            - `legacy=False`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer

            >>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google-t5/t5-base", legacy=False)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <extra_id_0>.")  # the extra space `[3]` is no longer here
            [8774, 32099, 5, 1]
            ```

        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word.

    Attributes:
        sp_model (`SentencePieceProcessor`):
            The *SentencePiece* processor that is used for every conversion (string, tokens and IDs).
